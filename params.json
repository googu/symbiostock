Optimize image processing scripts to use less memory. This is for webmaster using more constrained hosting/environments.\r\n2. A code cleanup and commenting run-through, pear standard, so a codex can be built.\r\n3. For fun, users familiar with css should create / distribute some simple child themes to create a little style diversity.\r\n4. Improve data validation and network interaction, so users cannot generate accidental errors.\r\n\r\n<h3>Symbiostock is currently in the testing phase. </h3>\r\n\r\nYou will notice you may want more features added. This is open source. They can be added! Please get more PHP developers involved in the project. I will add the most important features as they are agreed upon. For now, what we have is \"base functionality\" sufficient to a good start in testing.\r\n\r\n<em>The Symbiostock community has blossomed</em>, and its very helpful to new users and people not greatly familiar with wordpress and direct selling of their work. Over the course of time please work together develop a Symbiostock <em>\"Best Practice\" and \"Model Site\"</em> standard together. Please share design strategies, child themes, and other useful things that will make the Symbiostock network successful. \r\n\r\nThe most impressive aspect of Symbiostock isn't the theme, but the enthusiastic, hard working, helpful community that has surfaced. The rest is just details. \r\n\r\n","google":"UA-39881773-4","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
